This Data Science test consists of 2 separate tests:

Test 1. Image Classification of Numbers + OOP. This solution shows how works 3 different models with the MNIST Dataset for Image Classification (Random Forest, Convolutional Neural Network, and Feed-Forward Neural Network). 
Test 2. In this test realized recognition of 10 types of animals by input image and NER model for searching Animal labels in sentences. Also realized comparing a string with a sentence and input image for matching type of animal. 

The main goal of this test: understand how works Classification algorithms, understand Computer Vision, and NLP models.
