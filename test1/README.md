This project shows a comparison of three models of Image classification with the MNIST dataset:
1. Random Forest (RF)
2. Feed-Forward Neural Network (FFNN)
3. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

Also, you can see how one of these models can predict a digit by image.

Project structure:

Folder mnist_classifier: Contains model of image predictions models (RF, FFNN, CNN) and Mnist Classifier.
Folder images: Photo with a digit for predicting number from input photo.

How to use:
Run the code in the root directory by cmd: "pip install -r requirements.txt"

Demo: "demo.ipynb" in Jupyter Notebook.
